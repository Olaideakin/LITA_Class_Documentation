## Project Overview
---
This project serves as a comprehensive documentation of my learning journey as a Data Analyst in training at Incubator Hub. Throughout this project, I focused on mastering essential tools and skills, including Excel, SQL, and Power BI, to analyze and visualize data effectively.

## Data Sources
---
The primary source of Data used here are data generated in the course of training

## Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
1. For Data Cleaning
2. For Data Analysis 
3. For Data Visualization
   
- SQL- Structured Query Language for Querying of Data [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

- GitHub for Portfolio Building [Join Here](https://github.com/)
  
- Power BI(Business Intelligence) for Data Visualization [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)

## Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
The initial phase of the Data Cleaning and Preparations, will perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involves the exploring of the Data used during the cause of training:
1. what is the total sum of salary paid to each employee?
2. what is of the average age of the employee ?
3. what is the department of the employee?

## Data Analysis
---
This is where we include some basic lines codes or queries used during analysis:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE FIRSTNAME = JUSTIN
```

```Excel
Pivot Table
```
